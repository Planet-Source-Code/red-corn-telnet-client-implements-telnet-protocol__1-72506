### Description

I searched the telnet client for long time, but I don't know why the vb codes I found from psc didn't work in my environment. So I tried to code it myself. Now it works fine. I do not implement the key map, because I just use the telnet function as part of my project. Such as auto script and network management(using multiple telnet client of control array). I think it is useful so I share the telnet part. Hope it helpful to you.
